          <p class="m-b-3-xs type-georgia">In 1998, the IRS passed a new law making it legal for employers to enroll new employees into the company's 401k plan automatically. Employees were opted-in by default. <b>This brought new insight to behavioral design.</b></p>

          <p>In 1998, the IRS passed a new law making it legal for employers to enroll new employees into the company's 401k plan automatically. Employees were not <b>opted-in</b> by default. This change drastically increased 401k participation (obviously).</p>
          <p>This idea, first proposed by Richard Thaler, made savings incredibly easy. Yes—the same Thaler that won a Nobel Prize in economics. And published the best-seller <a class="a-default color-link" href={nudgeLink} rel="noreferrer">Nudge</a> —the book which introduced the world to behavioral psychology.</p>
          <p>An employee no longer needed to think about it.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How much should I contribute? → <b>6% by default.</b></li>
            <li>What funds should I choose? → <b>Pre-selected mutual funds.</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Broadly speaking, this type of design is called <b class="color-row--yellow">motivation design</b>. A design that leverages user psychology to align rewards and motivations to the intended action of the designer. </p>

          <h5 class="color-row--tan p-05 border-r-05">A city wants to avoid trash building up on the streets, so every resident automatically receives a trashcan to set out by default. Instead of the opposite (non-motivational design), a resident would need to call and order a trashcan if they want their trash picked up.</h5>

          <p>When choosing to opt a user in by default into a particular plan or feature, it's important to remember that it should benefit the user—not just the company. For example, purchasing a coffee at a local shop, and then a few days later, you start receiving emails from that coffee shop, even though you didn't ask to subscribe. This pattern is a quick way to frustrate and even lose customers.</p>

          <p class="xl"><b>Ideas How To Opt-In By Default</b></p>
          <p>There's a variety of ways, but here are some ideas I've designed for clients:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Automatically apply coupons to the checkout process instead of making them copy/paste the discount code.</li>
            <li>Defaulting users to the monthly plan and allowing them to choose if they want to change to an annual plan.</li>
            <li>If a user tries to create a new account with an email already associated with an account, prompt them to sign in and reset their password for them... since they likely forgot they had an account already.</li>
            <li>Automatically send an email warning when a longer subscription (like an annual plan) will renew. Even better, automatically send the user a receipt each time they're charged (even monthly). I've seen this strategy build a large amount of trust for brands.</li>
          </ul>
